# 🛡️ COBOL Catalyst

### **Industrial Forensic Assessment Engine**

COBOL Catalyst is a specialized heuristic environment designed for the precision identification of critical vulnerabilities within legacy financial source code and mainframe logic.

---

## **⬛ Forensic Standards**
The engine performs deep-path analysis on legacy structures to isolate high-tier risks:

* 🛡️ **Logic Integrity:** Detection of dynamic SQL construction within DB2/IMS procedures.
* ⬛ **Vault Auditing:** Identification of hardcoded administrative overrides and static keys.
* 🛡️ **Data Privacy:** Detection of unmasked PII/PCI strings within the DATA DIVISION.
* ⬛ **Fireserver Sync:** Authorized backend reporting for secure corporate audit trails.

## **🔳 Assessment Protocol**
1. **Target Selection:** Load a specific mainframe logic environment (Settlement/ATM/Perimeter).
2. **Catalyst Execution:** Initiate the assessment to generate a forensic risk report.
3. **Fireserver Integration:** Sync identified anomalies with the secure backend for remediation.
